# Leveraging OpenCV for Precise Yoga Pose Estimation and Reducing Injury Risks


# Overview
This project aims to detect and classify yoga poses in real-time using machine learning algorithms. The system detects various yoga postures from images or live video feed, providing instant feedback on pose accuracy and related benefits.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
TensorFlow




# Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing labeled images of various yoga poses.
The dataset is stored in the dataset folder, organized by pose categories.
# Model Training
Detailed steps for model training, including CNN, LSTM, and XGBoost, are available in the model_training folder.
# Results
Model evaluation results, accuracy, loss, and performance metrics are provided in the results folder.
